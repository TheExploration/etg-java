# Top-down Game

## A top-down shooter game where you survive waves of enemies. It will be used by people who want to play a game. This project is of interest to me because I like to make games.

User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to control the player and move around.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the game map from a top-down perspective (first in the console, then in a graphical interface).
- As a user, I want to be able to shoot a bullet (add a bullet to a projectiles class) 
- As a user, I want to be able to save the progress in the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to kill enemies in the game.
