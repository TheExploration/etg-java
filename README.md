# Top-down Game / 2d Game Engine

## A top-down shooter game and where you survive waves of enemies. Can also be used as a 2d Game Engine.

It will be used by people who are bored and want to play a game or someone who wants to create a 2d Game in Java. This project is of interest to me because I am particulariy interested in game development.

**User stories:**
- As a user, I want to be able to control the player and move around.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the game map from a top-down perspective (first in the console, then in a graphical interface).
- As a user, I want to be able to shoot a bullet (add a bullet to a projectiles class)
